            <p>
              My journey began in the UK, where on leaving school I studied
              carpentry, woodwork and basic trades and developed a passion for
              quality tradesmanship.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a dad of two boys, I have decided its time to embark on a new
              adventure. Im setting out on my own to enjoy more flexibility and
              quality time with my family.
            </p>

            <p>
              My goal is to help local families with those small but important
              jobs that can make a big difference in your home. I understnd the
              value of relible, trustowrhty workman, and I am here to offer just
              that. I am also avaialble as a carpenter to support local
              buildings firm when their work load is high and they need that
              extra pair of helping hands.
