            <p>
              My journey into the trades began in the UK, where I studied
              carpentry, honing my skills whilst developing a passion for
              quality tradesmanship. I ventured to Sydney spending nine years working on luxury builds and extensions with small carpentry firms. From there, my family and I embraced a new chapter in Perth, and recently I have been working on local roofing and timber framing projects.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a proud dad of two boys, Ive embarked on an exciting new adventure setting up Timber and Tools Services. This venture allows me to blend my professional expertise  with the flexibility to prioritize more family time.
            </p>

            <p>
             At Timber and Tools Services, our goal is simple: to assist local families with those crucial home projects that make a big difference. I understand the importance of reliable, trustworthy workmanship, and I'm here to deliver just that.
