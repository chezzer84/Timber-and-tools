            <h2>Meet the owner</h2>
            <h3>Hi, I am Dominic. Proud owner of Timber and Tools services.</h3>
            <p>
              My journey began in the UK, where on leaving school I studied
              carpentry, woodwork and basic trades and developed a passion and
              respect for quality tradesmanship.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a dedicated dad of two boys, I have decided its time to embark
              on a new adventure. Im setting out on my own to enjoy more
              flexibility and quality time with my family. My goal is to help
              local families with those small but important jobs that can make a
              big difference in your home.
            </p>

            <p>
              I understnd the value of relible, trustowrhty workman, and I am
              here to offer just that with a personal touch. Whether its fixing,
              building or improving, I'm exicted to bring my skills to your home
              and make life a little easier for you.
